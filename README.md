# kubernetes101

The objective is as follows:
1. To get familiar with kubernetes cluster environment.
2. Deploy a very basic express server app in a few different environments.
3. Expose the express server pods behind a service "Publically"(behind a load balancer)
4. Expose the express server pods behind a service "Internally" & Route this service via Ingress Controller.
5. Add Rules & configs for the ingress. 


The Express app being used in this will be from my another repository i.e.
"https://github.com/beyondszine/expressJsProductionTemplate"
